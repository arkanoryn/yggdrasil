# Yggdrasil project

> A single and simple playground project.

## Playground
I work on this project to learn two new concepts.
This application is only a playground for me to have fun and improve my knowledge over some technologies or concepts I am interested in.

Here is a small list, non exaustiv:
* Elixir
* Phoenix Framework - to handle any HTTP connection/request
* Microservice - separate the business logic into self-aware application
* GraphQL - use as database interface
* Concurrency, OTP, ... - Force asynchronious code, for the simple purpose of trying

**There is no end-goal for this application.**

## Architecture

* [vagrant.d]( ./vagrant.d/README.md ) -> Vagrant box configuration
* [client]( ./client/README.md ) -> Elm application
* [server]( ./server/README.md ) -> Elixir application

You will find instruction to setup each parts of the project at the root of each folder.

This project is meant to be developed using Vagrant as a development environment, instead of your own personal one.
